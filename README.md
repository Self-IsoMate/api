# Self-IsoMate API

This API is now documented. In order to view the documentation, please visit <https://self-isomate-api.appspot.com/api/docs>. If you're making any changes, please test before you deploy.

## Endpoints

If you are adding another endpoint, please make sure you add the necessary documentation before you deploy. What you need to do is add a comment above the endpoint (or if you're adding an extra method, add to the existing comment) and a swagger notation for the documentation.

## Models

If you've made a change to a model or have added a new model, you need to alter the documentation. For adding a new model, you need to make sure there is a swagger documentation comment where your model is, and that you've added the model js file to the API array in swagger config (in main.js).

If you're altering an existing model, please make sure you make the appropriate changes to the documentation comment that is there.
